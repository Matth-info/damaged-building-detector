# Downloading Data

This project provides custom PyTorch `DataLoader` implementations for several remote sensing and geospatial datasets commonly used in change detection, segmentation, and classification tasks.

In line with the principles of the [Model Openness Framework (MOF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13784), this document outlines how to access each dataset to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in AI research.

A selection of example images from each dataset is available in the data/data_samples directory.
